## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Through this starter project, I learned how static projects should be built, using pixels instead of percentages on larger screens, and swapping to percentages when the screen is smaller. This project was also used to learn how this development pipeline through Frontend Mentor and Github works.
